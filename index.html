        My name is Adeosin Oluwatobi Samuel and i am here to talk about my love
        for technology. Technology is the application of scientific knowledge
        for practical purposes or applications. The world is currently changing
        as we would have noticed we are currently living in a TECH world where
        we can carry out various actions with the use of technology in different
        aspect of life (industries, home, school, hospital, gym etc). Statistics
        shows that by 2050, there would be less manual workers and more of
        technological tools to perform work. This has led to my passion for
        technology and also why i am in the process of learning a TECH
        skill(Front End Development) which would be of utmost importance to me
        and the changes the tech world is currently bringing on.

        In my learning days at stutern, i have learnt that Software engineering
        is a process of analyzing what a client wants and then designing,
        building and testing software application which will satisfy the
        client's requirement. I also learnt that Git is a distributed version
        control which was developed to manage project with high speed and
        efficiency. I learnt about the importance of git which includes creating
        local repo, speed, security, open source branching etc. Git helps us to
        keep track of changes made in our file, collaborate with others to
        achieve a common goal, undo mistakes etc. On Github, one can create new
        repo, clone repo, git branching, git merging, git push, git pull etc. I
        also learnt about HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) which consists of
        different elements that tells the browser how todisplay the content. It
        is also known to describe the structure of a webpage. To carry out
        anything on HTML, it is advisable to use an HTML editor such as VS CODE,
        VIM etc. An HTML consists of tags, attributes, elements. We also have
        the HTML Table which allow developers to arrabge data in rows and
        columns, HTML list which is used to group a set of items in list
        (Ordered and Unordered list), HTML Form contains controlsuch as text
        field password field etc. We also have the HTML Heading and paragraph. I
        also learnt about CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) which helps to design the
        layout of a website and it is used alongside with the HTML. There are 3
        types of CSS which are inline CSS, Internal CSS and External CSS. I also
        learnt about the difference between Cascade, Specificity and
        Inheritance. CSS Box Model includes Margin, Border, Padding, Content.
        There are also various CSS properties.

        Border are used to set the border on an element. There are various CSS
        border properties which include border-style, border-color, border width
        and border radius which are used to specify the style, color and size of
        the border of an element respectively. Padding is the space between the
        content of an element and the border of an element. we have the top
        padding, right padding, bottom padding and left padding. Margin are used
        to define the space around element. it clears an area around the
        element.
